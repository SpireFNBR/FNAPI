Hi user, how to install:

Click on "code" on github and then "download zip" and it will start an installation in your browser, unzip it on your computer.

PYTHON & VISUAL STUDIO CODE (to start the APP)

START

Go to the unzipped folder and on the "main.py" file right click, go to "open with" and select Visual Studio Code, click on the "play" sign on the sidebar, and click on "Run and Debug" then on "Python Debugger" then on "Python File".
